# wejapa-first-project
wejapa internship  first project including some things about me and a gallery filled with some cool photos of me
I like the design i usedin this code because i get to use my best colours
But i had a little problem adding the border at the background with code but i later did it also made it responsive
I sincerely appreciate wejapa for giving us the opportunity to learn zero knowledge in coding and programming to be able to buid to design a website by myself
